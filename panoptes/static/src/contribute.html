        <br/> <br/>
        <strong>How Can I Contribute?</strong>
        <br/>
        <ul>
          <li>Report bugs</li>
          <li>Propose or implement features</li>
          <li>Submit code changes / fixes</li>
          <li>Discuss code</li>
        </ul>

        See <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">here</a> for a short tutorial for GitHub's issue
        tracking system.

        Please adhere to the <a href="https://github.com/panoptes-organization/panoptes/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">

        <br/> <br/>
        <strong>Reporting bugs</strong>
        <br/>
        Please use the project's issue tracker to report bugs. If you have no experience in filing bug reports, see
        e.g., these <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_writing_guidelines">recommendations</a> by the
        Mozilla Developer Network first. Briefly, it is important that bug reports contain enough detail, background
        and, if applicable, minimal reproducible sample code.
        <br/>
        Tell us what you expect to happen, and what actually does happen.
        <br/> <br/>
        <strong>Implementing features and submitting fixes</strong>
        <br/>
        Kindly use pull requests to submit changes to the code base. But please note that this project is driven by a
        community that likes to act on consensus. So in your own best interest, before just firing off a pull request
        after a lot of work, please open an issue to discuss your proposed changes first. Afterwards, please stick to
        the following simple rules to make sure your pull request will indeed be merged:
        <br/>
        <ul>
          <li>Fork the repo and create a feature branch from branch develop</li>
          <li>If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.</li>
          <li>Ensure that all tests pass.</li>
          <li>Document your code and update all relevant documentation.</li>
          <li>Stick to the code and documentation style (see below).</li>
          <li>Issue the pull request.</li>
          <li>Don't forget to add your name and GitHub profile URL to the list of contributors.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/> <br/>
        <i>Important: </i>Note that all your contributions are understood to be covered by the same license that covers
        the entire project.
